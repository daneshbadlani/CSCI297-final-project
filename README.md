Given the children's performance in two core classes, Mathematics and Portuguese, the machine attempted to predict the children's performance in secondary school, which will help improve the quality of education and enhance school resource management.

The dataset contains eduactional statistics of 395 students with 33 features, 16 of these being categorical data. Although of these 16, depending on how you manipulate the data, at least 11 features can be defined as binary features.
